# Here's a complex one-liner that performs multiple tasks in one go. 
# This will perform arithmetic operations on variables in memory, compare them using logical operators like AND OR NOT, 
# check equality and inequality with another value, convert values to binary and also calculate the length of strings:
    
a >= 0 and b := int(input("Please enter value b: ")), c = len(bin(int(input("Please enter another value c: ") if input() else ""))), e && f || g == h and i = j if k != l else m * n
    
# This statement does many things at once so It may be hard for others to read and understand your code. 
# One liners should generally be avoided since they make code harder to understand, debug and maintain. 
# Keep in mind there are always cases where you might need to use a one-liner but try to keep these to minimum.
