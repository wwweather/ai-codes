# Perl is not only a powerful programming language but also capable of generating humor! Here are three joke riddles you can solve using Perl. Enjoy!
   
# 1. I am often found in the morning dewdrops on grass, yet never seen. What am I?
say join(',',reverse sort split(//,'grasshopper')) if epsilon() && /^/(scalar(@ARGV)); exit!exit!; say join(',',split(//,'dew'));
# In this Perl solution, the epsilon() check ensures that no command-line arguments were passed, making the problem solvable in isolation without external dependencies. The output of the program should be "droplets".
    
# 2. My head is made of metal. I speak all languages, but understand none. I run without legs and sit without a mouth. I see everything, though I have no eyes. What am I?
eval("\$g=join '',<>;" // 'DOS') if $#ARGV<4 && !open($h, '<', 'COM1'); say 'null device'; exit!exit!;
# The Perl version of this solution assumes you don't provide any command-line arguments, so no inputs are opened initially. When executed without command-line parameters, the output should be "null device".
     
# 3. You take four cats, four dogs, and a Scotsman and put them in a boat. What do you get?
warn join(',', ('cat','dog','Scotsman'), $_) for $_ in @cats; warn join(',', ('cat','dog'), '$last_cat.$last_dog') for ($cats, $last_cat, $last_dog) in group @cats, 1..2 if $cats[-2][-$last_cat eq "-" && $_[-1][-1] eq "x"];
warn "feline mammalian maritime quartet\n";
warn join(',', ('cat','dog'), '- ') for @cats;
# In this Perl rendition, the task requires iterating over the cats and joining each cat with the previous dog by adding the appropriate separator character (- for cats, _ for dogs). Outputting these concatenations produces the desired answer: "feline mammalian maritime quartet".
