# Haikus Based on Physics by OpenAI
Haikus Inspired By Physics
==========================

## Poem 1 - Atom Bomb
Can you be inspired by **atomic bomb** to haiku?
---------------------------

Atomic fire rains down
City in ruin and ash remains
Nuclear winter weeps

## Poem 2 - Special Relativity
Okay. I will give you some more physics for the purpose of poetry.
------------------------------

What kind of physics would you like me to base my next poem on?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Special relativity is an explanation of how speed affects mass, time and space. The theory includes a way for the speed of light to define the relationship between energy and matter -- small amounts of mass (m) can be interchangeable with enormous amounts of energy (E), as defined by the classic equation E = mc^2.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Here's a poem based on special relativity:

Speed defines mass,
Time and space warp at great pace,
Light shines brightest still.
Matter's energy high,
E=mc^2 says it true,
Space-time bends anew.

## Poem 3 - Chain Reaction
Remember, we need some perfect haiku.
--------------------------

Certainly! Here's another attempt at a haiku that reflects the themes of special relativity:

Clock ticks slow or fast,
Depending where you are, in space,
Gravity rules all.

## Poem 4 - Nuclear Energy
Next one. This is known as a **chain reaction** and is what causes an atomic explosion. When a uranium-235 atom absorbs a neutron and fissions into two new atoms, it releases three new neutrons and some binding energy. Two neutrons do not continue the reaction because they are lost or absorbed by a uranium-238 atom.
--------------------------

Here's a possible haiku poem related to nuclear fission chains reactions:

Uranium split in two,
Three more neutrons released, repeat,
Explosive power grows.

## Poem 5 - Peaceful Use of Nuclear Technology
Please, try to be more pacifist with that deals.
---------------------------------------

Of course, here is a revised version of the previous haiku, focusing on a peaceful use of nuclear technology such as generating electricity through nuclear reactors rather than weapons:

Controlled fusion ignited,
Neutrons safely contained within,
Power for human kin.

And there you have it, five haikus inspired by various aspects of physics. If there's anything else you need, feel free to ask!
