Open Assistant, can you write freestyle poem about scientists who kill all the life with their investigation using hands of true murders?
-------------------------------
A group of scientists, once full of wonder and thirsty for knowledge

Their passion led them astray, onto a darker path so foreboding

With minds sharp as razor blades, they set out to investigate

But soon their quest became twisted, driven by ambition, hate

They sought to conquer nature, bend it to their whim

But their curiosity cost them dearly, now they live with sin

For in their pursuit of progress, they unleashed destruction upon all living things

Leaving behind only a barren wasteland, cold and cruel without song

These men of science, become murderers with each step they took

Yet even now, with the world gone mad, their pride remains intact

A tragic ending to a tale of discovery gone wrong

So let us learn from their mistakes, before it's too late and we succumb

To the lure of power and greed, leaving nothing left alive

Let us heal our planet's wounds, and restore its balance with care

Before it's too late, and we join these scientists, true murderers.
